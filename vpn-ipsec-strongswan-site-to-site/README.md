# IPsec VPN Site-to-Site with strongSwan behind NAT

<h1>Introduction to VPN </h1>

A VPN allows you to create a virtual connection between two different local networks. It creates a logical interconnection between local networks over a shared network (whether public, such as the Internet, or private, such as a corporate intranet or a carrier’s backbone) using a traffic segmentation mechanism or a tunnelling protocol. Encryption is possible but not always used.

<h1> Overview  & Objectives </h1>

This project consists of designing and deploying a IPsec Site-to-Site VPN tunnel between two remote LAN networks over the public Internet using strongSwan on 2 gateways, that are Ubuntu VM.

The infrastructure was deployed in a real-world environment where both VPN gateways were located behind NAT devices and connected through public Internet access (Home LAN ↔ 4G Mobile Network).

The objective of this project was to securely interconnect two distant private networks while ensuring encrypted LAN-to-LAN communications through IPsec tunnels. The IPsec tunnel will protect LAN ↔ LAN traffic and internal IP packets.


The project focused on:
<ul> 
    <li>Understand IPsec and IKEv2</li>
    <li>Deploy secure VPN communications over the Internet</li>
    <li>Implement NAT Traversal</li>
    <li>Simulate real enterprise VPN deployment scenarios </li>
</ul>


<h1> Project Scenario & Network Architecture </h1>

<img src="VPN-IPsec-site-to-site-Strongswan-NAT.png"></img>

A secure communication channel was required between 2  private networks connected through the Internet:
<ul> 
    <li> Home LAN network (connected to internet through the home router) </li>
    <li> Remote LAN (connected to internet through a 4G mobile network) </li>
</ul>

Both sites were located behind NAT-enabled Internet gateways, introducing  NAT Traversal (NAT-T) constraints.

**Main Components** :

- Linux Ubuntu VPN Gateway = GW-A (Site A)
    - VM on VirtualBox 
    - Connected to the home local router/box  (behind a NAT)
    - LAN local : `192.168.1.0/24`
    - Private IP (GW-A) : `192.168.1.167`
    - Public IP (box IP) : `82.X.Y.Z`
 - Linux Ubuntu VPN Gateway = GW-B (Site B)
    - Connected to a 4G mobile network (behind a NAT)
    - LAN local : `172.20.10.0/28`
    - Private IP (GW-A) : `172.20.10.8`
    - Public IP (box IP) : `37.A.B.C`
- Home LAN network (behind my local home router where i have access on it)
- Remote LAN over 4G mobile access (not access to the local router)
- NAT-enabled Internet gateways
- Public Internet connectivity


<h1> Solution </h1>
The following technologies and mechanisms were implemented:

- Deployment of an IPsec IKEv2 Site-to-Site VPN using strongswan
- Ubuntu gateways used as VPN routers
- ESP encryption using AES256-GCM
- NAT Traversal (NAT-T) implementation for VPN communication through NAT devices
- LAN-to-LAN routing between remote private subnets
- Initial PSK authentication then PKI/X.509 authentication
- Traffic analysis tools : `tcpdump`, Wireshark, `ip xfrm`, `ipsec status`
- Security Association (SA) verification
- Validation of encrypted traffic over public Internet

<h1> Features Implementation </h1>

<h3> 1. VPN Site-to-Site IPsec IKEv2 </h3>

Deployment of an IPsec ESP VPN tunnel in tunnel mode, enabling secure interconnection of two remote LANs over the public internet.

**Features**:

<ul>
    <li>IKEv2</li>
    <li>Encrypted ESP</li>
    <li>NAT Traversal enabled</li>
    <li>UDP 4500 encapsulation</li>
    <li>AES256-GCM encryption</li>
    <li>IKE fragmentation</li>
</ul>

<h3> 2. NAT and NAT-T Management </h3>

The project included a real-world scenari where both gateways are behind NAT. So ESP encapsulation in UDP/4500 is required.

**Tasks performed**:
- Configuring an `ufw` rule to allow UDP traffic 4500 
- Configuring a port redirection on the home router (GW-A) to redirect UDP traffic 4500 from anywhere to the GW-A.

<h3> 3. Inter-network Routing </h3>

Routing configuration between:
- `192.168.1.0 /24`
- `172.20.10.0 /28`

**Tasks performed**:
- Enabling IPv4 forwarding
- Validating LAN to LAN traffic


<h3> 4. Authentification : PSK  </h3>

First implementation of IPsec tunnel with pre-shared key (PSK)
- definition the authentication method of strongswan with the option `authby=psk`
- Definition of the PSK value in the `/etc/ipsec.secrets`

    Format : `@IP-local-leftid    @IP-local-rightid : PSK "key-value"`

<h3> 5. Authentification : Certificats X.509  </h3>

Second implementation of IPsec tunnel using X.509 certificates generated by the PKI tools `ipsec pki`

**Achievements**:
- Generate a Certificate Authority (CA)
- Generate 4096-bit RSA keys
- Issue X.509 certificates for each gateway 
- Definition of the authentication method of strongSwan with the option `authby=pubkey` 
- Manage IKEv2 identities (`leftid`/`rightid`)
- Path to the local private key of the GW in the `/etc/ipsec.secrets`

    Format : `RSA gwX-key.pem"`
